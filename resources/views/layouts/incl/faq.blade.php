               <p class="answer">
                  A premium is the amount you pay to the insurer in exchange for the insurance policy's benefits. These
                  payments can be made on a regular basis, for a specific number of years, or only once, depending on
                  the options available under the policy you choose.

               <p class="answer">
                  A term life insurance policy protects the policyholder until he or she reaches the age given in the
                  policy. A beneficiary will get a death benefit if the policyholder dies before the term expires. If
                  the policy holder's life should outlive the term, the policy can be renewed for a premium at the
                  conclusion of the term.

                  Several life insurance products in India provide various tax benefits. Section 80C of the Income Tax
                  Act of 1961 allows you to deduct up to Rs.1.5 lakh in life insurance premiums paid. In addition, the
                  nominee can claim a tax deduction on the insurance payouts received under Section 10 (10D).

                  However, of the different life insurance policies available in India, term insurance is one of the

               <p class="answer">By assigning a life insurance policy, one might transfer his or her title, rights, and
                  interest in it to another entity. This is usually done to provide security for a loan or to protect
                  the other person's financial interests. The assignee will receive the benefits of the life insurance
                  policy once it has been allocated. The policyholder must complete the assignment form and return it to
                  the insurer, along with the policy details that must be allocated. In addition, the individual must
                  send the original insurance as well as the assignee's KYC documentation. The assignment can be
                  endorsed on a copy of the life insurance policy or a notarized assignment, indicating that it can be
                  carried out.

               <p class="answer">The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has launched a
                  two-wheeler long-term insurance plan. As a result, you won't have to renew your two-wheeler insurance

                  policy. Furthermore, by choosing long-term insurance, you will be protected from annual increases in
                  third-party rates, resulting in significant savings.</p>

               <p class="answer">Personal loans can assist you in dealing with a variety of financial difficulties;
                  however, they
                  do have certain advantages and disadvantages that you should be aware of. Here are some
                  of the drawbacks and benefits of taking out a personal loan.
                  <br />
                  <b><u>Benefits:</u></b>
               <ul>
                  <li><b>No collateral required:</b> A personal loan does not require any type of collateral or
                     security, and you can easily apply for one as long as your credit score is decent.</li>
                  <li><b>Less documentation required: </b>Personal loans demand far less documentation than conventional
                     secured loans. </li>
                  <li><b>Rapid Approval:</b> Several banks have implemented an e-application process that is both
                     speedier and more convenient. Some banks even provide e-approvals and pre-approved personal loans.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Flexibility:</b> Unlike other secured loans, there are no restrictions on the usage of money
                     borrowed with a personal loan.</li>
               </ul>
               <br />
               <b><u>Drawbacks:</u></b>
               <ul>
                  <li><b>Qualification standards:</b> While personal loan guidelines differ from bank to bank,
                     qualification conditions are extremely stringent. To get a personal loan, you must have a strong
                     credit history.</li>
                  <li><b>Higher Interest Rates: </b>Personal loan interest rates are lower than credit card interest
                     rates, but they are still higher than secured loan interest rates.</li>
                  <li><b>Prepayment penalty: </b>On prepayment of Personal Loans, several banks apply a prepayment
                     penalty.</li>
