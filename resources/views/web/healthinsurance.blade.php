    <h3 class="title">Types of Health Insurance Plans in India</h3>
    <p class="para">Health insurance policies are of two types-</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Indemnity Plans</b>
            <p>Indemnity plans are traditional health insurance policies that allow the policyholder to claim hospital expenditures up to the sum insured. Multiple claims can be made by policyholder until the maximum limit is reached. Your insurance company will pay for your medical bills in one of the two ways: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Reimbursement Facility-</b>
                    You pays the costs first, and then the insurance company reimburses you.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cashless Facility-</b>You won't have to pay any bills because your insurance company will pay them directly to the hospitals.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p class="para">
                The following are the sorts of medical insurance policies that fall into the category of indemnity plans are:
                <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                    <li><b>Mediclaim Insurance</b>
                    <p>Illnesses and mishaps do not require advance notice. The same may be said regarding the costs incurred when a person is admitted to a hospital for any of the reasons. In the event of an illness or an accident, the Mediclaim Policy ensures that you are compensated for your hospitalisation expenditures. It covers in-patient costs such as doctor's fees, nursing, surgery and oxygen among other things. Mediclaim Policy is a type of insurance that is offered in the market as group medical insurance, individual medical insurance, overseas medical insurance, and so on</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Individual Coverage</b>
                    <p>This insurance policy is for a single person, as the name implies. Other family members, such as spouses, children, parents, and so on, can be added for an additional fee. Each insured person will be assigned a certain sum assured amount. For example, if you have Rs.1 lakh individual health insurance policy and your wife is also insured, you can each claim up to Rs.1 lakh. This sort of insurance covers your medical expenses such as hospitalisation, surgery, room rent, and day-care operations, among other things.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, premiums are calculated based on an individual's age, medical history, and sum insured. A claim lodged by one member of an individual plan has no bearing on the sum insured of the other insured member. If you are single or do not have children, you can purchase an individual health plan for yourself and your spouse and benefit from the sum covered on an individual basis. Because of the complete coverage and the sum assured that is provided, the premium is slightly greater than a family floater plan. If you are insured for an existing disease, however, there is a 2-year waiting time before you can receive payments.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Features of an Individual Health insurance Plan</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This plan is available to people between the ages of 18 and 65.</li>
                        <li>Covers hospitalisation due to illness/injury, surgeries, room rent, day-care treatment, etc.</li>
                        <li>Basically it covers an individual but there is an option to buy separate policies to cover each family member.</li>
                        <li>Amount of the individual sum assured for each covered member.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li class="mt-3"><b>Family Floater Coverage</b>
                    <p>The Family Floater Health Plan is a low-cost insurance plan that covers your entire family, including your spouse, children, and elderly relatives, under one policy. Only one family member is responsible for paying the premium, and the complete family is covered for a single fee. This plan has a lower rate than individual health insurance policies that cover the entire family. The insured amount is distributed evenly among the members. If two family members require treatment at the same time, you can file a claim for both of them until the maximum is met. The premium is calculated based on the eldest person who will be covered under the plan. As a result, try to avoid including family members over the age of 60 in your family health insurance plan because they are more likely to become ill, and thus the premium will be affected.</p>

                    </ul>
                    </li>

ULIP returns are paid to the buyer at the end of the policy term. The returns are determined by the market's performance. </p>

          <b>Factors for consideration before buying health insurance plans</b>
          
          <p class="para">With so many health insurance plans to choose from, it's easy to become confused about which one is right for you. Here are some things to think about while choosing the medical insurance that best suits your needs.</p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>
               <b>Claim settlement process:</b>
               <p>Before purchasing a health insurance policy, review the insurer's claim process; the simpler the claim process, the sooner the claim will be settled. Look for after-sales service as well. When obtaining health insurance, excellent customer service is critical. The person should choose an insurance company that offers a quick claim settlement.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Policyholder's Age:</b>
               <p> When purchasing health insurance for oneself or family members, the buyer must grasp the significance of the age element. There are a variety of plans available according on the buyer's age, as well as premiums, waiting periods, and renewability. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Medical History of Family Members:</b>
               <p> When purchasing a health insurance policy, it is important to evaluate and discuss the medical history of family members because it can affect the policy's price. If one of the family members already has a health problem, the chances of filing a claim for insurance increase.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Deductibles:</b>
               <p>Before purchasing any form of health insurance policy, it is critical to research the policy's deductibles. A deductible is a sum of money that the insured must pay as part of a claim when arises, with the insurance provider covering the rest.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Waiting Period:</b>
               <p>In the context of a health insurance policy, the waiting period refers to the amount of time you must wait before receiving the benefits of your coverage. The length of the waiting period varies by plan. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Hospitals in the Network:</b>
                  <p>When purchasing an insurance policy, the consumer must select the insurance provider that covers the most hospitals on their list. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Sum assured:</b>
                  <p>The sum assured is the amount of money that the insured person will receive at the conclusion of the insurance period. The sum insured is the amount paid to the insured in the event of an unforeseeable occurrence like as a medical emergency, theft, or car damage. When purchasing a health plan, consider the sum assured amount, which covers medical bills. Age, income, the number of family members, pre-existing ailments, and other factors all play a role in determining the appropriate medical insurance sum insured.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Renewability for the rest of one's life:</b>
                  <p> Different Health Insurance Plans have different possibilities for renewability. As a result, you must exercise caution when purchasing one for yourself or a family member.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Cashless treatment:</b>
               <p> Choose an insurer that allows you to receive cashless treatment at one of its network hospitals. It's best to choose with a company that has a large network of cashless hospitals. Cashless treatment eliminates the bother of paying hospital bills because the insurer pays the medical fees directly to the hospital. Note that deductibles (if any) must be paid by the policyholder during claim settlement.</p>
              </li>

               <b>Maternity cover:</b>
               <p> Medical costs associated with pregnancy can be rather significant. As a result, choose a medical plan that includes maternity coverage. Check the waiting period for maternity claims, as well as the policy's sub-limit.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Medical check-up and value-added services:</b>
               <p> Look for a health plan that includes free medical exams. Some insurance also offer value-added services like lab testing and medication discounts.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Exclusions:</b>
               <p> A insurance exclusion is a provision that prevents coverage for a specific risk. Pre-existing conditions, pregnancy, cosmetic treatment, medical expenses to treat injuries, alternative treatments, lifestyle-related disorders, hospital cost constraints, and diagnostic testing are all frequent exclusions in most health insurance policies. As a result, while purchasing health insurance, the customer must address these exclusions with the insurance provider.</p>

        <h3 class="title ">Reasons to Buy Health Insurance:</h3>
        <p class="para">Apart from the ever-increasing medical costs, health insurance is purchased for the following reasons:</p>
        
        <br />
        
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Comes with Lower Premium</b>
                <p>
The cost of health insurance is significantly lower now than it will be later in life. Because you're less likely to get sick at this time, insurance companies will charge you a lesser price for a health insurance plan because you're a low-risk eater. When you compare premiums in your 30s and 50s, you'll notice that the latter costs twice as much.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Easy to Get Insurance</b>
                <p>
It's difficult to get health insurance if you have a pre-existing condition. Even if you receive it, you'll have to pay a higher price. If you fail to disclose a condition at the time of purchase and then file a claim for a complication resulting from that disease, your claim will be rejected by default. Because you are less susceptible to such illnesses when you are young, getting health insurance is simple.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Increase Your Tax Savings</b>
                <p>The insured receives tax benefits for paying the health insurance premium under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act of 1961. When you get health insurance when you're young, you get a tax break for a longer length of time than if you buy it later in life.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reap the Benefits of Savings</b>
                <p>In other words, health insurance is a type of investment that allows you to protect yourself financially from unforeseen events. If you start investing when you're young, you'll acquire the habit of saving later on. Because inflation has a significant impact on every aspect of our lives, developing a savings habit can help you cope with it to some level. 
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>No Waiting Period</b>
                <p>Health insurance has waiting periods, such as a 30-day initial waiting period, a 2- to 4-year waiting period for pre-existing illnesses, and so on. It may, however, differ from one insurer to the next. You do not need to file an insurance claim if you are in good health.  This manner, you can easily complete the waiting period and file your insurance without difficulty.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Avail Bonus</b>
                <p>
Health insurance comes with a bonus. One such prize is the No Claim Bonus, which ranges from 20% to 50% and is offered for not claiming your insurance. The NCB is granted as a discount on consecutive years' premiums or as an increase in the sum insured. When you're young, you have fewer odds of filing a claim, so you may maximise your NCB bonus and get the most out of your health insurance policy.
