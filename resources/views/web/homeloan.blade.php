   <p class="para">
      A home loan is a secured bank loan used to purchase or construct a residential property, such as a house/flat or a plot of land for house construction, or to renovate, extend, and repair an existing home by using it as collateral. The title or deed to the property will be held by the bank or financial institution until the loan is repaid in full, including interest. The payment period as well as interest rate on a home loan might be adjustable or fixed. It provides high-value capital at low interest rates and for long periods of time. EMIs are used to repay them. Some banks are offering the most appealing housing loan interest rates, which begin at 6.50% per annum. The majority of banks and housing finance companies approve house loans ranging from 75% to 90% of the property value. Low processing fees, provisional approval, a 30-year term, and adjustable EMIs are just a few of the many advantages of house loans. The title to the property is returned to the borrower after repayment.</p>
   <p class="para">
        In addition, under Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act, you may be eligible for tax benefits on your house loan. However, only first-time home buyers are eligible for the income tax deduction on house loan interest.

         <h3 class="title theme-orange">Types of Home Loan</h3>
         
         <br />
         <h5>There are various types of home loans that are available in :</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Purchase of a flat in an apartment complex with a home:</b>
                  A home loan can be obtained for a residential apartment complex that is either under development or is ready to occupy. Banks fund their customers' purchases of apartments in apartment complexes. The concept of an Undivided Share in the land is introduced here.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Home loan for purchase of a single house: </b>
                  Banks fund their customers' to purchase a ready-to-move-in or under-construction bungalow or standalone house with a home loan. This is comparable to the above-mentioned Home Loan, but there is no idea of UDS ownership. The borrower owns the entire property. Such homes, of course, have a higher resale value.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Home loan for land/plot purchase:</b>
                  Banks lend money to those who want to buy a vacant plot of land and build a house on it later. Typically, banks require that building of the house begin within one year of the land acquisition in order for the loan to be considered a home loan. You can purchase a buildable parcel of land. Some lenders require you to start building your home within a year of purchasing the land.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Home loan for building a house on your own property:</b>
                  You can get a loan to build your house on your own land. Banks have their own techniques for calculating construction costs. Naturally, you'll need to get permission from the local municipal officials to build your home on the property. You must also have a plan that has been approved. If you obtain approval from the municipal corporation and an approved building plan, you can get a loan to build a house.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Home loan for home improvement/extension:</b>
                  You can get a home loan from a bank to finance home improvements or house extensions. You must have the necessary approvals and plans in place in the latter instance. These loans are intended to be used to upgrade or renovate an existing home or flat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Home loan balance transfer: </b>
                  You can move your home loan balance from one bank to another using this service. This facility may be beneficial if you have a high-interest home loan. You might refinance your outstanding debt with another lender at a lower interest rate, saving money on interest. Transfer your current house loan to a bank or non-bank financial institution that offers better home loan eligibility and interest rates

         <h3 class="title theme-orange">Eligibility For Availing Home Loan:</h3>
         <br />
         
         <p>Your Home Loan eligibility is determined by a number of variables. For both salaried and self-employed individuals some basic guidelines are applied .Some banks require self-employed people to have a higher take-home pay percentage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Your current earnings: </b>
                  Salaried personnel must present three months' worth of pay slips as well as a bank statement showing where their pay cheque was deposited in the previous six months. Bank Statement for 1 year is required in case of Self-employed professionals of accounts in which income is credited for services provided.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Employment/business Continuity: </b>
                  Salaried employees can use their income tax returns, Form 16, Form 26AS, and other documents to demonstrate their employment continuity. They can also present a statement from the Provident Fund account to establish the links. Self-employed businessmen and professionals can file income tax returns as well as other financial documents such as a balance sheet and profit and loss statements. They can also provide copies of their clients' bills.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Current obligations:</b>
                  An applicant may have pre-existing personal debts, vehicle loans, or other loans for which they are making monthly payments. When calculating Home Loan eligibility, you must account for these instalments as well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Credit history</b>
                  The applicant's payback history is quite important. CIBIL or another credit bureau is a member of every bank or financial institution. Every borrower's loan activities are tracked by these bureaus. They establish a profile of your credit history and quantify it by calculating your credit score based on it. This value varies between 300 and 900. Your credit score has an impact on your capacity to borrow money. If your credit score is high, there are higher chances of getting approval. Defaults, repeated loan requests, and missing payments, to mention a few examples, all have the potential to damage your credit score.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Legal position:</b>
                  mortgage on the land and building that has been financed is the primary security for any house loan. You must first form the mortgage and then register it with the appropriate registering authorities. To do so, you must have legal authority to create the mortgage. As a result, banks and financial institutions demand a legal scrutiny report from their panel of attorneys, who conduct a 30-year search to establish the ownership chain.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Borrower's age: </b>
                  The borrower must be at least 21 years old when applying for a house loan and the age of maturity should be 65 years old. Increased time limit up to 70 years in case of certain institutions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Property valuation: </b>
                  The value of the property you acquire is critical. The cost of the project that will be funded by the financing bank must be determined. Banks often finance up to 75% to 90% of the property's value (also known as LTV or Loan to Value Ratio), with the remaining amount being your contribution, or margin, as they call it.
