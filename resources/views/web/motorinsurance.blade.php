     Car Insurance is required while purchasing a new car. A comprehensive car insurance policy, 
     often known as motor package insurance, saves you money if your car is destroyed in an accident 
     or a natural disaster. It also safeguards your vehicle against theft and break-ins. 
     You risk injuring others or causing property damage in the event of an accident. 
     An automotive insurance coverage also covers third-party liability. 
     When your car is involved in an accident, you should focus on getting over the shock rather than 
     worrying about the financial implications. To get through any such crisis with as little stress as 
     possible, you should always carry adequate car insurance and keep it in force.
   </p>
   <p class="para">In India, you must get third-party insurance if you own an automobile. To stay on the right side of the law and be covered against car damage, it's critical to get and renew your coverage on time.</p>

What are the different types of car insurance policies?
</h3>
<ol>
    <li class="mt-4">
        <b>Comprehensive car Insurance policy</b>
   <p>
   A comprehensive car insurance policy provides you with complete coverage. It covers not only the expenses of damages to a third party, but also the costs of damages to your own vehicle, i.e., it covers your personal and third-party liability. This coverage type also covers car theft as well as damages caused by fire, explosion, burglary, weather, natural disasters, and man-made disasters.    
   <p>You won't be able to file a claim unless you have comprehensive insurance if your automobile is damaged and the cause isn't a road accident.</p>
   </p>
   
   <br />
   <p><b><u>Features of Comprehensive Car Insurance Policy:</u></b></p>
   <ul>
       <li>Collisions in automobiles and other risk factors are covered.</li>
       <li>Additional riders can be added to increase the coverage of policy.</li>
       <li>The policy package includes vehicle theft protection.</li>
       <li>It offers a wide range of coverage possibilities.</li>
       <li>It includes third-party accidental damage.</li>
   </ul>
   
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
        <b>Stand-alone own-damage car insurance</b>
   <p>
   As the name implies, it refers to damage to your own car. You are covered for any accidental damages to your insured automobile with stand-alone own-damage car insurance. Natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and landslides, as well as man-made calamities such as theft, burglary, riots, and strikes, may be the reason. You must have an active third-party insurance coverage on your vehicle in order to get this insurance. It helps you avoid having to pay for the repairs out of your own wallet. The cost of standalone own-damage car insurance is high at first, but it gradually drops as the vehicle gets older.
   </p>
   
   <br />
   <p><b><u>Features of Stand-alone own-damage Car Insurance Policy:</u></b></p>
   <ul>
       <li>Only covers damage to the insured vehicle.</li>
       <li>It includes coverage against damages caused by riots, terrorism, or other acts of terrorism.</li>
       <li>Accidental injuries, as well as the medical and hospitalisation costs that arise, are covered.</li>
       <li>Add-ons can be purchased to protect against a range of other damages.</li>
   </ul>
   
    </li>
    <li class="mt-4">
        <b>Third party car insurance</b>
   <p>
   The Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 mandates that every motor vehicle owner in India buy at least third-party insurance coverage. You are covered under this form of insurance coverage for legal obligations originating from an accident, such as death or injury to a third party or damage to their property caused by the insured vehicle. It also compensates the covered car's owner-driver in the event of accidental death or incapacity. In this sort of insurance, the claimant is not required to show that the car that caused the collision was negligent. If there is an accident, it does not cover the car or any valuables in the car.
   </p>
   
   <br />
   <p><b><u>Features of Third party Car Insurance Policy:</u></b></p>
   <ul>
       <li>Appropriate for older automobiles.</li>
       <li>Covers Property Loss.</li>
       <li>Cost-Effective.</li>
